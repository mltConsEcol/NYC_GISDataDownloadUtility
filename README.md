# NYC_GISDataDownloadUtility
Development of R functions/tools to automate download and update of NYC-oriented GIS and GIS-related Datasets

Currently testing on linux virtual machine. The code calls on wget, which had to be installed on Windows, but didn't work as expected in that environment.

A sample of the data table the code calls on is at ./inst/extdata/DataList.csv (users should clear out dates for complete testing).
